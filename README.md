# 📊 Predicting Hydrostatic Pressure from Ocean Data

## 🏆 Competition Context
This project was created for the **Regression Rumble** competition, part of **Neurontara Data Clash 2025**. The main objective is to predict **hydrostatic pressure** from complex and diverse ocean-profile data using regression techniques.

A unique challenge in this task is that the feature `total_light_exposure` is only available in the test set, but missing from the training data. This requires participants to apply smart feature engineering or develop creative alternatives to build accurate and reliable models.
